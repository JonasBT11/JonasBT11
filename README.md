An analytical scientist at the beginning of my Data Analytics journey. 

With some python experience already acquired, I'm looking to build on this and explore many other programming languages! SQL and Tabeleau look to be valuable parts of a recognised data analyst's skill set, I'm excited to learn all of this from others and hopefully teach myself as I did with Python.

Working in the scientific and environmental field with data is something that hugely interests me and is relatable to my previous experience as a scientist but any data-driven role in the field would allow me to apply my analytical mindset and the passion for uncovering insights.
